            <p>A Real Madrid symbol. The eternal captain who represented Madrid&apos;s values on the pitch. Raul was a forward with an almost infinite instinct. He was an example for everyone, putting in the maximum effort in every game, irrespective of the opponent. He would give it his all, having an insatiable appetite, something that was evident with each action. He was always alert for rebounds. An excellent role&hyphen;model for anyone who has ever dreamt of being a footballer.</p>
